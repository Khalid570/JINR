Neutrino Event Topolgies in OPERA Experiment
==============================================

OPERA experiment aims to detect for tau neutrino $(\nu_{\tau})$ in the appearance mode emerging from neutrino oscillations of a pure sample of muon neutrinos $(\nu_{\mu})$. This repository uses CERN Open Data and performs data analysis to serve 2 purposes:

1. Analysis of the decay topology, represented by the decay length and the impact parameter, of the charmed hadrons. This acts as a cross-check for the efficiency of detecting the tau particle because they exhibit a similar decay topology.
2. Plots of the multiplicity distribution of hadrons along with the angular distribution of the muon tracks resulting from the $\nu_{\mu}$ CC interaction. This aids in the reconsturction process as to eliminate the final-state particles' tracks that reconstruct back to a $\nu_{\mu}$ neutrino.

Refer to the directories and the report for extra details.
