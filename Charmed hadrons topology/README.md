# Charmed-hadrons-topology
This repository represents the analysis of the decay topology of the charmed hadrons resulting from the muon-neutrino-charged-current interaction in OPERA experiment.
This serves as a cross-check for the efficiency of the detectors before doing the analysis on the tau particle because the charmed hadrons have a similar decay behavior of the tau particle. 

The decay topology analysis is represnted by,

1) Decay length: the magnitude of the displacement between the primary vertex ,where the charmed hadron is produced, and the secondary vertex, where it decays. 
2) Impact parameter: the vertical displacement magnitude between the primary vertex and the trackline of the decay. 


Chapter 3 of this report: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tfdjelHIKcIzsss20fQ8swOOr6klUFXL) is devoted to this analysis.
